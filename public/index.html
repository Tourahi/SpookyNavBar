      <h1>SpookyNavBar</h1>
      <p>You are Light, a wizard living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a staff and a spellbook. You finish your long journey and finally arrive at the ruin you've been looking for. You have come here searching for a mystical spellbook of great power called the book of essence. You look around and see nothing but the broken pieces of old bookshelves.
        "This was a reading room... this was a library...", you think. Suddenly, something catches your eye.

        > You grab it.
        You pick up a large book and try to open it. As you do so, the cover opens by itself and reveals a large gem inside.

        > You neutralize the magic of the gem.
        You place your index and middle finger on both sides of the gem and rub it back and forth. A faint hum is heard as the gem changes into a small box.
        "This is very strange...", you think.

        > You open the box.
        You open the small box and find something inside. It is a small golden disk. You turn it over and over in your hands.
        "This is the Eye of the Dragon. What does it do?"

        > You summon a fairy.
        You close your eyes and concentrate. You concentrate hard until your hear a voice in your head.
        "I am here, wizard. What do you wish to ask?

        > You say "What does the Eye of the Dragon do ?"
        The fairy sits on a small golden disk and spins. Suddenly, a portal opens up. You step through it and you find yourself in a beautiful garden. You notice a small man sitting on a bench.

        > You say "Where are we fairy ?"
        "Silence, wizard! I am talking!"
        "Sorry, fairy."
        You notice that the fairy has a small golden key hanging from a chain around his neck.

        > You walk to the small man sitting on a bench.
        You approach the small man and notice that he is a skeleton.
        "Where are the remains of this man?"
        "He fell from the sky. From out of the sky came a dragon, who ate him."

        > You say "Does that dragon have both of his eyes"
        "I think so."
        "OK, fairy. Thank you."
        You pick the Eye of the Dragon up and notice a small not on the bottom of the box.

        > You read the note.
        The note reads:
        The Eye of the Dragon
        To be used only in dire emergencies, this enchanted disk can be placed anywhere that you have a clear view of the sky.

        > You put the eye back in the box.
        You put the box in your backpack.
        "Fairy, thank you for your advice."
        "Give me something to do afterwards, wizard. I don't like sitting here."
        "OK, fairy. Goodbye."

        > You go to the City library.
        A cool breeze blows as you step into the large room. You look up and see rows and rows of books.
        "There has to be something in here about dragons."
        You flip through several books.

        > You ask for the Dragons section.
        A librarian walks up to you.
        "What do you want?"
        "I'm researching dragons."
        "And?"
        "Is there a section on dragons? Did they have a section?"
        "I think it's the whole library."
        The librarian snorts and turns away.
        "Thanks, I'll find it myself.

        > You grab a book about the eyes of the dragons.
        You begin flipping through books until you find what you're looking for.
        "I think this is the book I need."
        The book is a large, outdated book with browned pages. You begin to flick through the pages.
        "Ah, here it is."
        The book contains several short paragraphs, and several strange symbols. You turn to the last page, and find the symbol for the dragon's tear. You trace it with your finger.
        "What do these symbols do?"

        > You read about the symbol.
        Dragon Tear
        The dragon tear is the water that comes from the dragon eye when it is dropped. It can be used as a powerful poison, yet is safe and drinkable.

        > You search dragon summoning.
        You flip through pages until you find a list of several books.
        "I think I'll search summoning."
        You spot the book and grab it. You skim through the pages and find what you're looking for.
        "Ah, here it is. Dragon summoning."
        You flip through the pages until you find the section on dragons. Unfortunately, it's not much more than a list of facts.

        > You read the facts.
        When a dragon is born, its mother feels the painful process of childbirth. The mother must lay an egg, which she does over the course of a few days. The mother then abandons the egg, leaving it in a plant in the sunshine until it hatches.
        You close the book and smile. This is exactly what you need.

        > You ask a librarian is there any dragons near the city ?
        You search the library, but you don't find the section that you're looking for.
        "I can try the other library."
        You turn and leave the library.

        > You ask if there is dragons near the city.
        You start walking to the other library, but a gust of wind hits you in the back and throws you face first into the dirty road. You get up and brush yourself off. You walk down the street and start wondering where to search for a library.
        You see an elf sitting and i ask him if there is any dragons near the city ?
        He looks at you and sniffs.
        "What? Do I smell?"
        The elf shakes his head.
        "No, I was just wondering the same thing. You look lost.

        > You say "Hello i am Light Who are you"</p>
